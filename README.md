# WordPress 0.71-gold modified to work under PHP 7


* WordPress version 0.70 was released on 27th May 2003. 
* On 2nd Feb 2017, it reached 5,000 days of age.
* This is a fork of WordPress 0.71-gold ( released 9th June 2003 ).
* It's been modified to run under PHP 7.
* I only got so far before making the screen capture.
* There doesn't seem much point in continuing to fix all the problems.
* Though I might fix the spelling mistake.
